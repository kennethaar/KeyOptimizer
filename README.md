# KeyOptimizer
Makes improvements to your keyboard so you too can become a keyboard ninjaâ„¢.

## How it works
This script makes holding the down the Nordic AltGr key transforms the letter keys on the home row into navigation keys (arrow keys /del/home/end/pgup/pgdn). It moves Enter, Backspace and Delete right below the home row. And lets you execute (Undo/Redo/Copy/Cut/Paste) without twisting your left pinky to reach the Ctrl key. With this simple AHK script you have all you need to turn your keyboard into a powerhouse of easily accessible shortcuts.

## Why you should use it
It takes a little time to get used to, but it is comfortable, fast and requires very little movement of your hands. These modifications also make you a keyboard agnostic ninja, letting you jump between your laptop and regular keyboard without missing a beat. As we know laptop keyboards always have some keys in unusual places because of their size constraints. With is script you don't have to relearn any keyboard, just use your right thumb to press AltGr and then press the corresponding letter key.

## Warning
If you don't have the AltGr key, but a regular right alt key, you might be out of luck, since it could seriously mess with other applications. This is because many apps use Alt as the accelerator key.

##Warranty
There is absolutely no warranty whatsoever. None, zero, zilch. If this script eats your computer. Well, too bad. There is nothing I can do about it. But please let me know of any issues and I can look into it. Who knows, We might even solve a bug or two together
