# KeyOptimizer v003
**Makes improvements to your keyboard so you too can become a keyboard ninja™.**

This script makes holding the down the Nordic AltGr key transform the letter keys on and around the home row into navigation and edit keys:

### Navigation
- AltGr+W = Up↑
- AltGr+A = Left←
- AltGr+S = Down↓
- AltGr+D = Right→
- AltGr+H = Home←
- AltGr+J = End→
- AltGr+U = Page↑
- AltGr+I = Page↓

### Editing
- AltGr+M = Backspace
- AltGr+N = Enter
- AltGr+ . = Select All
- AltGr+ , = Delete
- AltGr+C = Copy
- AltGr+V = Paste
- AltGr+X = Cut
- AltGr+P = Print Screen

To suspend hotkeys use AltGr+1

## Why you should use it
It takes a little time to get used to, but it is comfortable, fast and requires very little movement of your hands. These modifications also make you a keyboard agnostic ninja, letting you jump between your laptop and regular keyboard without missing a beat. As we know laptop keyboards always have some keys in unusual places because of their size constraints. With this script you don't have to relearn any keyboard, just use your right thumb to press AltGr and then press the corresponding letter key.

## Warning
If you don't have the AltGr key, but a regular right alt key, you might be out of luck, since it could seriously mess with other applications. This is because many apps use Alt as the accelerator key.

### Installing
EXE version:
1. Just download the KeyOptimizer.exex file and doubleclick on it. In your tray you should see a keyboard icon. Hovering over it should show you how to suspend and reactivate it.
